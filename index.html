								<h1><strong>Joshua Silva</strong></h1>
								<h3>About Me</h3>
							</header>
							<p>
								I am Joshua Silva, a final semester software engineering student with a passion for designing impactful and accessible user experiences with software. I cut my teeth in development making over a dozen short games and interactive experiences that has taught me many skills and given me a basic direction in this vast industry (available via portfolio). Watching someone interact with a project I’ve work on or developed and seeing a smile or look of total engagement on their face gives me an immense amount of satisfaction. Every piece of software we use is a tool and designing those tools to be the most engaging and accessible they can be, allows the most people to achieve flow with said tools.
							</p>
							<p>
								As engineers it’s easy to focus on the work, the project, the software, but at the end of the day it’s about remembering that an actual person will be interacting with it on the other end. It was my time developing videogames in university that pushed me to learning the importance of adding accessibility features to software to cater to your target audience. My UTS Global Short trip to Malaysia for a Data Science Camp also showed me how I can apply my focus on user experience to the field in a more concrete way with the help of data analysis and consistent feedback.
							</p>
							<p>
								I will continue to strive to improve my skills in crafting engaging and accessible user experiences that leave even just momentary bursts of joy in others feeling that they have been deeply seen and considered. With attentiveness and empathy I will pursue mastery in my field and one day, maybe leave a lasting impression on someone else with my work.

					<h2>Reflections</h2>
					<h3><strong>Reflection 1:</strong> Principles of sustainability to create viable systems</h3>
					<p>
						Almost by definition, a truly viable system is one that remains viable across time, and that
						implies a degree of sustainability. Unsustainable systems don’t last the long term after all. While
						sustainability often refers to managing the effect on the environment, it also refers to ability to
						remain viable and functioning of social, economic, and cultural systems. My example below is a
						group project, what I am classifying as a social system.
					</p>
					<p>
						In 2024 I took a games development elective where we had two large group tasks to complete
						over the semester. As I was away during the first week when groups were formed, I was placed
						into a group I hadn’t chosen and hadn’t met. The group was very slow to get going and several
						members were away on a semi-regular basis. The first assessment task had a tight deadline
						that required us to get a prototype early on and iterate on it each week before another
						scheduled class of testing. To meet this weekly deadline with such a fragmented group, I had to
						put massive amounts of work in to produce something worthwhile to show in class. The other
						group members weren’t really pulling their weight and the pace I was going at was not
						sustainable for me on top of the other classes I was taking that semester.
					</p>
					<p>
						After the rushed submission for the first assessment I decided to talk with the group and tell
						them about how the distribution of work wasn’t very equal. To my surprise, the group had an
						immediate response that they knew they were under-contributing due to their own workloads
						and hadn’t realized how much extra work I was putting in to keep the group moving forward.
						After this chat, they resolved to contribute far more to the second assessment to equalize the
						difference in contributions. What I learned from this experience was the value in knowing your
						own limits of your working ability and setting clear boundaries to maintain a sustainable pace in
						large projects. There’s no reason to burn yourself out working on a project when you have a
						team that can help share the weight. If we had established these clear boundaries of
						contributions from the beginning, I probably wouldn’t have burned out in the first place.
					</p>

					<h3><strong>Reflection 2:</strong> Professional Practice within intercultural and global contexts</h3>
					<p>
						I went for a Global Short exchange program to Malaysia in January 2024 and during my time
						there we had a final group presentation assessment before we finished. Also on this trip we
						were assigned buddies from the university we were attending that would show us around and
						offer help if needed. Over the course of the trip we became good friends with the buddies. On
						several occasions they recommended local experiences and locations to visit during our stay
						and, being from outside the culture, it was a great help to have an easily accessible source of
						local knowledge.
					</p>
					<p>
						As the trip went on, my group got a little anxious about how the work on our final presentation
						was coming along, and so we decided to ask the buddies for guidance. They were forthcoming
						in sharing how assignments normally go for them and how the marking of this kind of
						assignment is done a lot less seriously than we were taking it. It’s common for presentations at
						UTS to focus on covering each of the marking criteria first with a secondary objective of not
						boring your audience. The opposite seemed to be true for this assigned task. After talking it
						through with the buddies, we decided to pivot to a more lighthearted approach to our
						presentation to better fit the tone that was expected of presentations at this university and this exchange program. The final presentation ended up going well and our team received plenty of
						cheers from our chosen approach.
					</p>
					<p>
						While it was quite a mild incident, what I learned from this experience was the usefulness in
						listening to local knowledge in any matters that cross cultural boundaries. It’s easy to bring your
						our assumptions from your culture and think that it applies to everyone everywhere else. But if
						you take the time to listen and ask questions, you’ll often find that different cultures approach
						the same tasks differently and the easiest way to close this gap is to ask for local knowledge. In
						the end we parted as good friends with the buddies and still occasionally share inside jokes
						from our trip. My time in Malaysia taught me a lot about intercultural communication that I will
						take with me through my lifetime.

						RE: Industrus Engineering Graduate Application - Joshua Silva <br> <br>
						
						Dear Hiring Manager, <br> <br>
						
						I am excited to apply for the Industrus Engineering Graduate Program. As I come to the end of my studies as a dedicated software engineering student at UTS, I am looking for a graduate role or an entry-level position to apply my technical skills, problem-solving ability, and enthusiasm for developing innovative software solutions. I believe my qualifications and personal nature align with your mission and needs.
						<br> <br>
						Through my studies, internship, portfolio projects, and other educational opportunities, I have established a solid foundational understanding of Python, C++, Java, JavaScript, HTML, CSS, and Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) fundamentals. I cut my teeth on programming through participating in over a dozen game jams over the last few years where I was tasked to make a fully playable game on a tight deadline (often a weekend or sometimes a week) with unique constraints. These experiences elevated my problem-solving skills and ability to work efficiently under pressure. Interning at Tritusa Consulting accustomed me to workplace culture and standards, and taught me useful IT skills that further diversified my existing software engineering skillset. I also have experience with Agile development through university studio subjects where I worked with the company Good360 to expand their mobile app functionality and later with a startup called Chirp Check to build a machine learning model that accurately identifies birds based on recordings of their songs. Though most importantly, I have an excessive curiosity to continue to learn and develop my skills as an engineer.
						<br> <br>
						My previous experience in the service industry and extra-curricular activities has refined my leadership and communication skills. As an executive for the Literary Society at UTS I was in charge of organising, scheduling, and managing events that ranged from monthly book clubs to Opera House visits to watch live performances. I have also done volunteering work with FIRST Australia and their robotics competitions to aid in the running of the events and as a judge offering insightful criticism to student-led robotics teams. I work well in a team environment, knowing when to speak and more importantly, when to listen. When I am invested in a project, I see it through to completion and to the best of my ability. I don’t shy away from unconventional ideas until tested, and I’m known for my creative approach to problem solving. My time on exchange in Malaysia also expanded my awareness of the advantages of cross-cultural approaches to challenges in our ever-increasingly global world.
						<br> <br>
						These are my skills so far, and I’m aware I always have much to continue to learn. I hope you consider me for this position where I can add value to the company and ultimately further develop my ever-growing skillset.
						<br> <br>
						Regardless, thank you for your time and consideration.
						<br> <br>
						Sincerely, <br>
						Joshua Silva
